iOS Pong Starter
================

This is an XCode project for the iPad that demonstrates a basic Pong
implementation and some simple game development techniques (timers, gesture
recognizers, and animation).  It can be used as a starting point to build 
a more advanced game.


Requirements
------------

XCode 4.2 and iOS SDK 5.0.


Setup
-----

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the *pong.xcodeproj* file in XCode.
4. Build and Run.


Contributions
-------------

The intention of this project is to provide the most basic implementation for
developers to build on.  If you want other people to see the cool things you've
done with it, be sure to fork the project so other developers will find you.
